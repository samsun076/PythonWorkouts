Create a dict in which the keys are usernames and the values are passwords, both represented as strings. 
Create a tiny login system, in which the user must enter a username and password. 
If there is a match, then indicate that the user has successfully logged in. 
If not, then refuse them entry. (Note: This is a nice little exercise, but please never store unencrypted passwords. Itâ€™s a major secu- rity risk.)
